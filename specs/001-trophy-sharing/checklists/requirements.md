# Specification Quality Checklist: Team Trophy Sharing App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 13, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items passed validation. The specification is comprehensive and ready for the planning phase. The three user stories (P1 priority each) represent independently testable slices:
1. Session creation is the foundation
2. Trophy submission enables content collection
3. Trophy presentation is the culmination

The functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) are specific, testable, and cover all aspects of the workflow. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, with both quantitative metrics (time-based, volume-based) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, accuracy).
